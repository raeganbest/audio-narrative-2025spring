### "The Beautiful Game"
My audio narrative - "The Beautiful Game" - seeks to encapsulate the major sounds, emotions, and scenes of a soccer match. It starts with the fans' excitement pre-game, and then transitions to the match itself. Throughout the course of the match, the narrative goes back and forth between the perspective of the player and the fans, seeking to build tension as the player makes their way towards goal.

### Creative Process and Overall Experience  
This was my first time using Audacity, so it was an entirely new experience for me. I knew off the bat that I wanted my narrative to be about a soccer game, but it took me a while to know how exactly I wanted to illustrate that. It was very easy to find the majority of the clips I needed on FreeSound, so my beginning stages mostly revolved around those clips. It was a bit harder for me to figure out how I was going to incorporate my own recordings, along with what would be the easiest way of doing so. I eventually decided to just go outside and record myself dribbling around, and used that to shape the different perspectives of the narrative.

If I were to be completely honest, I ran into quite a few issues with Audacity. I found that the program would be glitchy when you tried to move the clips around, and it seemed like I had to do a lot of micromanaging (for example, the program insisted on replaying the sounds even after I had told it to pause so I could fix something). Another glitch I ran into was that one day it would not let me open the AUP3 file straight from my computer, as an error message kept coming up. I ended up having to download the file from my repository through the website. When I was approaching the final days of working on the assignment, I ran into a lot of issues exporting the new AUP3 file and pushing it onto my repository. The file kept saving at an astronomical size, so there was no room to push it. To fix this, I had to keep copying and pasting the clips into a new project, and then resaving the new version. This was even an issue I had when turning in my final copy of the AUP3, as I ultimately had to remove a layer of the crowd sounds and cut out my post-narrative message. However, these elements are still included in the MP3. 

While I was gradually creating and refining my piece, I found myself getting frustrated with how it was turning out. The shifting of perspectives was something I could illustrate very well in my mind, but it was hard to translate into a purely audio format. However, given my lack of previous experience, I feel that my final draft came out fairly well.

### Baseline Requirements
Despite my initial difficulties meeting the time minimum, I managed to meet all the baseline requirements for the project. In the end, my narrative ended up being around 1 minute 55 seconds. To depict change in my piece, I had it start with the crowd making its way to the stadium and then shift to the game itself with the sound of the whistle. Throughout the match, I went back and forth between highlighting the player and the crowd, which was another way I shifted perspectives and situational locations. There were three main sounds recorded by me - dribbling, breathing, and the person yelling "hey" - and the rest of them were found on FreeSound. I technically layered four tracks of sound overlapping at various times throughout the piece, but to make sure my AUP3 file would export properly, only 3 layers are depicted.  

### Aspirational Inspirations 
I did a lot of playing around with different effects to construct my piece. Some of the more basic tools I used were compression and amplify, cross-fading, and audio splitting. Here are some of the more advanced tools I tried out:


**Low pass and distortion**

To enhance the feeling that the game is taking place in a stadium, I used low-pass to add distance to the clips. The screenshot above includes the guidelines I used to gradually make the crowd sound further and further away. To supplement this feeling, I also used distortion effects. I used the effects to further immerse the listener into the scene, taking on the feelings of the player as they focus more on the game and less on the outside noise.


**Pitch**

When the player yelled "hey!," I wanted to make them sound more masculine. To do so, I recorded myself doing the yelling, but then altered the pitch so that the voice was lower. 


**Spectral Tools**

When I recorded the clips of me dribbling, I was outside near a construction site on a relatively windy day. I used the spectral tools in an attempt to enhance the sound of just the grass and the ball, and cut out most of the background noise. 


### Peer Feedback

A common theme among my feedback was that it was unclear that it was a soccer game happening. To try to make it more evident for those who are not knowledgeable or aware of these types of events, I used the spectral tool to enhance the sound of the person dribbling. The other things they mentioned (like having a goal scored) had already been included, so I mostly focused on the player side of things to make the setting more clear.

### Conclusions
Overall, despite the plethora of obstacles and many frustrations, I am ultimately content with how my narrative came out. If I were to change anything, I may shift the perspective of the piece to focus more on the fan than the player.
